Challenging my data skills tracking the highly competitive Hockey East Conference of NCAA DI
Hockey East, formed in 1984, when founding hockey powerhousese Boston College, Boston University, UMass-Lowell, Maine, New Hampshire, Northeastern, and Providence ceded from the ECAC after dissention with member Ivy League competitiors. One of the prominent collegiate conferences that is exclusively New Engalnd and prides on earning national championships. 

As a resident in the Boston area who attends matches, I am intrigued to apply the practical competencies, put a stat to a player's or coach's name and watch a intriguing season unfold.
